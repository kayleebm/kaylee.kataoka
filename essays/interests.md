## From Curiosity to Code <img src="../img/Breaking Bugs/undercover.png" width="50px" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 10px;">

As a high school senior, one of the most common—and overwhelming—questions I faced was, “What are you going to study in college?” At the time, I was unsure and felt the pressure of making such an important decision. One evening, while watching TV with my family, we came across a show called Undercover Underage. It followed a team working to expose online predators by going undercover and catching individuals attempting to meet with underage children. One episode featured Hawaiʻi’s cyber security division within the Department of Homeland Security, and in that moment, something clicked. I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in technology with a purpose. I’ve always had a strong interest in electronics—from my first iPod to my current MacBook—so software engineering felt like a natural path. My goal is to use the skills I gain in this field to help protect communities from cybercrimes and to raise awareness about the risks of weak security systems. 

## Breaking Through the Bugs <img src="../img/Breaking Bugs/challenge.png" width="45px" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 10px;">

My journey in engineering has been anything but easy. Throughout high school, I was often labeled as an “academically gifted” student—someone who could excel without much effort or preparation. I rarely had to study extensively to perform well on exams or assignments. However, entering college challenged that narrative. I quickly realized that success at the collegiate level would require far more discipline, focus, and resilience than I had previously needed. Adjusting to this new academic environment meant late nights, countless hours of studying, and moments of self-doubt, especially when I struggled to grasp material that others seemed to understand effortlessly.

Despite these challenges, I remained committed to my long-term goals. Over time, I developed more effective study habits, improved my time management, and learned how to persevere through setbacks. My academic performance gradually improved, and I began to find enjoyment and purpose in many of the engineering courses I once found intimidating. Balancing the demands of school, running my small business, and coaching volleyball has been a significant challenge, but it has also taught me valuable lessons in responsibility, prioritization, and grit. These experiences have shaped me into a more well-rounded and determined individual, better prepared for the demands of both engineering and life beyond the classroom.

## Engineering the Future <img src="../img/Breaking Bugs/cybersecurity.png" width="40px" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 10px;">

Cybersecurity has become one of my greatest passions while studying engineering. I am deeply motivated by the goal of creating a stronger, more informed community—one that is equipped to recognize and defend against cyber threats. My ultimate aspiration is to work in the Cyber Crimes Unit at the Hawaiʻi Department of Homeland Security, where I can contribute to the prevention of child sex trafficking and other forms of cybercrime. I want to use my education not only to build a career, but also to give back to the community that has shaped me.

Kamehameha Schools, my alma mater, played a foundational role in preparing me for the challenges of college and inspiring my dedication to service. I hope to one day return the favor by supporting its students and initiatives in meaningful ways. Long term, I envision starting my own engineering firm focused on developing innovative, affordable cybersecurity solutions. I am especially passionate about protecting vulnerable populations—such as the elderly—who are disproportionately targeted by online scams. My goal is to make cybersecurity more accessible, ensuring that safety and protection online are not a luxury, but a standard.
