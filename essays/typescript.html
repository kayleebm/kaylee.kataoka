## Opinons on Typescript <img src="../img/essay/header/why.png" width="50px" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 10px;">

Typescript has been an interesting tool to use so far. I havenʻt had a ton of experience with it so learning it was a little difficult to me. Typescript is a great tool becauase it is able to catch bugs early on. For example when using the typescript playground I was able to catch many bugs before running the code. It was also able to produce outputs quickly which is helpful in making sure my outputs match. With typescript I also had to learn java which was a challenge at first but doing all the intro to java modules really helped me get a better grasp on the language. Overall I think typescript is a very useful tool and should be used more often.

## Comparison to other languages <img src="../img/essay/header/Eyes.jpg" width="45px" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 10px;">

In comparison to other languages I have learned, typescript is more challenging to me. It uses java which has more technical aspects compared to languages such as python. I do have experience with the C language which I feel is the most difficult. Typescript functions faster than most languages I know as well as is able to produce outputs quickly like I talked about previously which I appreciate. It helps me to know if my code is correct or needs improvement in certain areas. Although there are many advatages to using typescript I donʻt think this would be the first language I use if I had to pick. 

## Growth Through Challenges <img src="../img/essay/header/Struggle.png" width="40px" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 10px;">

Both TypeScript and the WODs have reinforced an important lesson: growth comes from stepping outside my comfort zone. TypeScript’s strong typing and error-catching features encourage me to think critically about my code, while the WODs push me to improve my coding speed and resilience under pressure. Together, these experiences have not only improved my technical skills but also taught me the importance of adaptability and persistence in software engineering. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate TypeScript into future projects to maintain scalability and use timed coding challenges to sharpen my problem-solving abilities.
