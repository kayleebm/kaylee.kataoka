## Opinons on Typescript <img src="../img/essay/header/why.png" width="50px" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 10px;">

Typescript has been an interesting tool to use so far. I havenʻt had a ton of experience with it so learning it was a little difficult to me. Typescript is a great tool becauase it is able to catch bugs early on. For example when using the typescript playground I was able to catch many bugs before running the code. It was also able to produce outputs quickly which is helpful in making sure my outputs match. With typescript I also had to learn java which was a challenge at first but doing all the intro to java modules really helped me get a better grasp on the language. Overall I think typescript is a very useful tool and should be used more often.

## Comparison to other languages <img src="../img/essay/header/Eyes.jpg" width="45px" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 10px;">

In comparison to other languages I have learned, typescript is more challenging to me. It uses java which has more technical aspects compared to languages such as python. I do have experience with the C language which I feel is the most difficult. Typescript functions faster than most languages I know as well as is able to produce outputs quickly like I talked about previously which I appreciate. It helps me to know if my code is correct or needs improvement in certain areas. Although there are many advatages to using typescript I donʻt think this would be the first language I use if I had to pick. 

## Should Typescript be used as a software engineer? <img src="../img/essay/header/Struggle.png" width="40px" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 10px;">

From the perspective of a software engineering I feel that typescript can be very useful for building and maintaining complext systems. After doing a little research typescript has static typing which helps to catch bugs during compile time instead of run time which will help with errors. Typescript is also scaleable and has strong typing interfaces which can give engineers the confidence to work independently. For me personally I enjoy the fact that typescript can be used with many different apps such as VS code. I use VS code for many projects because its easier to read while editing.

## WODs

The WODs are a hands on way to learn and practice our skills which I enjoy. Iʻm a person who needs to apply the skills learned in order to retain information. With the WODs I am able to apply what Iʻve learned from modules or lesson videos then check my answers with the video demonstration. I appreciate the video demonstration at the end as it gives me a better perspective on what to do for the next WOD or if Iʻve done it correctly. The WODs are also quick in the sense that I donʻt have to spend a ton of time sitting there and recoding. Some assignements Iʻve had to code for 3-4 days in which I donʻt learn anything because Iʻm so frustrated of having to redo things continuously. With the WODs so far if I make an error it doesnʻt take me days to figure out but instead a couple minutes.

## Learning Style

I personally enjoy the asynchronous learning style. This gives me the flexibility I need in my life as there is a lot going on day to day. Iʻm a very organized person so these classes donʻt hinder me as I know that my learning is completely in my hands. Being able to do assignments and learn on my own time is much less stressful than having to attend a lecure at a certain time everyday in which some days I canʻt necessarily make it and Iʻll be behind on course work.
