summary: "Learned to lead, code, debug, and collaborate through a complex LAN simulator project that tested both my technical and teamwork skills."
---
Working on the LAN simulator project taught me a great deal about how local area networks function and how to simulate them using code. I developed a deeper understanding of networking concepts like file transfers, socket communication, and the structure of network topologies. This was a highly technical project that required both independent research and teamwork. I learned to navigate debugging complex systems, manage time effectively under pressure, and collaborate closely with peers. Being a team leader also pushed me to take initiative and ensure everyone stayed on track with their tasks.

Through this experience, I became more comfortable using tools like Python, VS Code, and collaborative platforms while improving my ability to communicate effectively in and outside of class. The project helped me build resilience in the face of setbacks and taught me the importance of seeking help early. While there were challenges in maintaining consistent group participation, I learned how to adapt, stay motivated, and support my team. Overall, this project gave me valuable insight into real-world systems engineering and reinforced both my technical and interpersonal skills.
