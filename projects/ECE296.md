This project was part of a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) where we explored machine learning by developing algorithms capable of playing board games. Our focus was on the game Goats and Tigers, in which the objective for the goats is to escape the tigers. The goal of the algorithm was to outplay a human opponent. We implemented the game using Python and gained hands-on experience with neural networks and large language models.

Throughout the semester, we deepened our understanding of how to make algorithms smarter and more efficient through coding, testing, and iteration. By studying the strategies of the game and occasionally outsmarting the algorithm, we identified weaknesses and refined our code accordingly. While this was a technically intensive project with a strong focus on programming, it also incorporated applied mathematics and machine learning concepts. Additionally, the project emphasized collaboration, as we worked closely with peers and our advisor, strengthening both our teamwork and communication skills.
